### What is error.os?
error.os is a Debian GNU/Linux based distribution. As of now, it only comes with a ***Minimal KDE Plasma*** version where all packages are selected based on user needs and preferences. The distribution is designed to be lightweight and efficient, with a focus on simplicity and usability. We provide a set of pre-installed applications to make it functional in this minimal KDE scenario. Our aim is to be a better daily driving operating system.

### Philosophy
We encourage users to customize, break, and rebuild error.os to their liking. We do not restrict anything or deliver any type of datacenter or cloud services. We are a community-driven project that believes in open source and free software. We do not need your personal information and thus we don't track you or your activities.

### Why the name error.os?
Error exists in every type of operating system. Others hide it behind terms like 'stable' or 'unbreakable', but no system is completely free of errors. Instead of hiding or fearing errors, let's acknowledge them. Sometimes, what seems imperfect can create a strong foundation.

<h1>Void</h1>
<div>Void is a branch of error.os that could be called "testing" but isn't exactly that. These are ISOs that boot but may have some issues. We ship them regardless so users can preview upcoming features. Currently, Void v1 and v2 releases are available as unstable/early versions of Neospace 2025. Learn more about it by <a href="https://zynomon.github.io/error.doc/docs/000/VOID.html" target="_blank">clicking here</a>.</div>
