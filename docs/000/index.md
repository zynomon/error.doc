### What is error.os?
error.os is a debian GNU/Linux based distribution as if now it only comes with a ***Minimal KDE Plasma*** version where all packages are picked up after understanding the user's needs and preferences. The distribution is designed to be lightweight and efficient, with a focus on simplicity and efficiency. we also provide a set of pre-installed applications that can make it, atleast usable in this minimal kde scenario. we have aim to be better as a daily driving operating system. 

### Philosophy
we incourage users to customize , break , rebuild error.os as thier liking we do not restrict anything or or we don't deliever any type of datacenter or any type of cloud services. we are a community driven project and we believe in open source and free software we do not need any of your information or your any personal data and thus we don't track you or your activities. 

### Why the name is error.os?
error is in every type of Operating system , they hide it in the name of 'stable' or unbreakable system, but no they are not fully stable error is everywhere and it's not hidden or it's just not visible to the user. Instead of hiding or fearing it , let's show the truth about it. something lame can make a foundation strong.
