### VOID is a branch of error.os,
which can look different or behave different in different versions for now we have v1 and v2 which was beta of neospace 2025

# VOID v1
VOID v1 is the first version of VOID, which was experimental neospace 2025 it was released in september 2025. yes, at the same month when the project started, it was made using penguin's egg in debian 13 , also however i <zynomon aelius> didn't knew /etc/skel existed. which was funny because i made configs but they didn't saved globally. but it retrieved the application sets. which was atleast something made it a part of error.os 
#### Known Issues
- No error.os theming
- No error.os Repo
- Also filled with bloats given by penguins egg.

# VOID v2
VOID v2 is the second version of VOID, which is made after VOID v1. We basically made few applications such as vex , onu instead of using featherpad or falkon which really made the iso smaller but NO, this time it's being made using debian live build command line tool. and in this version we made a full fledged system that boots and shows owr own theme however onu as a browser is still experimental and i <zynomon aelius> added the calamares however it didnt installed it.

#### Known Issues
- No calamares installer ( you can install it manually)
