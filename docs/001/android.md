    Yes, people do brick their systems by booting in a corrupted operating system or if the user is new in this field however, this guide will help you to repent that + make a bootable usb drive.
    First, ensure that you have a USB Thumbdrive also known as a USB Flash Drive or pendrive.

    You can do it in the cheapest way possible by using a SD Card with a SD card reader. Because you don't need 128+ GB of pendrive just to flash a 3 GB ISO file. It's recommended you have it instead. So go to a store nearby, pick up a good SD card, then buy an SD card reader and insert the SD card into the reader and it will be done.
