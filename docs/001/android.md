      Yes, people do brick their systems by booting in an corrupted operating system or if the user is new in this field however, this guide will help you to repent that + make a bootable usb drive.
      First, ensure that you have a USB Thumbdrive also known as a USB Flash Drive or pendrive.

      you can do it in the cheapest way possible by using a SD Card with a SD card reader. because you don't need 128+ gb of pendrive just to flash a 3 gb iso file. it's recommend you to have it instead. so go to store nearby pickup a  good SD card then buy SD card reader and insert the sd card into the reader and it will be done.
